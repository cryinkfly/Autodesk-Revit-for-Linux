Autodesk Revit is a building information modelling software for architects, landscape architects, structural engineers, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineers, designers and contractors, what you can use only on a system where is Windows installed as the operating system.

But the problem is that there are also people like me who don't want to use either of these two operating systems on there systems. Then these users have installed a Linux distribution such as openSUSE Leap, Ubuntu or Fedora.

And so I got the idea to start this project here to find a way to solve this problem. 

I started looking at different tools and my choice was Wine! 

With this nice tool we don't need longer two operating systems for Autodesk Revit, when we will create a fantastic project in the future or if you want to work on a project with other people.

Is that a great idea for the future?

Personally, I think this idea is good and for this reason I will do my best to give you the opportunity to use it on Linux as well!
